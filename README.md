# typescript-CountDownTimer

In this implementation, we first set the target date and time using the new Date() constructor. Then, we use the setInterval() function to update the countdown every second.

Inside the interval function, we get the current date and time using the new Date() constructor. We then calculate the difference between the target date and time and the current date and time in milliseconds.

Next, we calculate the remaining time in days, hours, minutes, and seconds using some basic math. Finally, we print the remaining time to the console using the console.log() function.

You can customize this implementation by changing the target date and time or the format of the output.
